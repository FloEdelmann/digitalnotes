  - Uses plugin `Least Cost Path`
  - Input: Cost Raster, Start Point(s) Layer, End Point(s) Layer
- [docs.qgis.org ~ QGIS Network Analysis Tools](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/training_manual/vector_analysis/network_analysis.html)
  - Calculates shortest/fastest route based on road layer and user selected start and end point on map
  - By default points have to fit perfectly on road layer, which is impossible via manual selection on map
    - Solution: Set `Topology tolerance` higher than `0 meters`
  - `Road Graph Plugin` seems to have been merged into these tools according to [this source](https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/297243)
