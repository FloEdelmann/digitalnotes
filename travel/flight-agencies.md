  - no info regarding luggage weight
  - horrible e-ticket: 
    - misleading luggage info: first checkin yes, on e-ticket/online no, airlines website: yes
    - two e-mails for e-ticket
      - flight numbers on one
      - pnr not clear to find
      - e-ticket number not obvious and with '-'
        - check on airline page like air india by removing
  - **BUT**: if paypal is selected, ticket iternary is created already as paypal can be paid later
    - so it can be used as dummy ticket (?)
      - valid flight info
