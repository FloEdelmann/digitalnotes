## Tested and Nope

- Crypto.com
  - After countless codes via SMS and email it's just too complicated:
    - The Exchange doesn't support FIAT, I need to buy via app which I assume has shitty rates - Assumption! TODO: double check
    - TODO: find stable coin that can be transfered to another exchange for very low fee, TRON network for USDT is not supported :/
  - Via website I tried adding USD bank account but it automatically sets bank country and billings address country to India...
    - No solution yet, it seems to base both locations from phone number country predial
  - Minimum deposit 20 EUR [see here](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/2461467-fiat-wallet-eur-bank-transfers-via-sepa-network)
    - Incorrect: Successfully deposited 1 EUR in Oct 2021
  - Free top up via TransferWise and Paypal [see here](https://blog.crypto.com/free-fiat-top-ups-for-transferwise-and-paypal-users/)
  - There is now super button in the app "Exchange" on Android...
    - Solution: Downloaded crypto.com app in Google Play Store
  - Downloaded crypto.com but when I want to log via sent email login link the app tarts signup process...
    - "Solution": Logged in with no problems with an older account
