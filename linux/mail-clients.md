- evolution
  - Sometimes removes line breaks before sending -_-

## Nope

- claws-mail
  - Does not download all messages via IMAP
    - Maybe cannot handle folders with spaces?
  - Does not update folders that have been with another client
  - Once account is set to POP3, cannot be changed to IMAP
    - Must be created as new account -_-
- geary
  - Horrible user interface
