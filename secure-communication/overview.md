- [Invisible Internet Project (I2P)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P)
  - Is an anonymous network layer (implemented as a mix network)
  - Allows for censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer communication
  - Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user's traffic (by using end-to-end encryption)
  - Sending via volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world
  - Is free and open sourced and published under multiple licenses
  - All communication is end-to-end encrypted (in total, four layers of encryption are used when sending a message) through garlic routing
  - Even the end points ("destinations") are cryptographic identifiers (essentially a pair of public keys)
    - Neither senders nor recipients of messages need to reveal their IP address to the other side or to third-party observers.
  - Is an anonymous peer-to-peer distributed communication layer
  - Designed to run any traditional internet service as well as more traditional distributed applications
    - Designed so other software can use it for anonymous communication
  - Started as a fork of Freenet
