## Current State

Disadvantages of iOS App [Money Flow - Spending Tracker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/money-flow-spending-tracker/id900890647)
- no import functionality
- no webapp version
    - limited to slow two finger input
- no recurring expenses
    - interestingly implemented as reminders in [CashSync: Expense tracking](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cashsync-expense-tracking/id617849961)

## Looking For

- PhoneApp with
    - Recurring Spendings
    - WebApp with
        - Import from CSV and JSON
        - Export to CSV and JSON

## Checked WebApps

- www.moneytracker.cc
    - Positive
        - Import of `CSV`
    - Negative
        - Import only of `CSV`
        - Export only of `JSON`
        - Exported data cannot be imported
            - python script as a temporary workaround?
