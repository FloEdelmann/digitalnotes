## Daily Limit VISA Credit Card
2x 600 EUR sent on same day via Transferwise. Thus daily Limit is at least 1200 EUR. (see Sat 01 Feb 2020)

Money from checking account is automatically transferred to credit card account if balance is negative.

### Checking account cannot cover credit card balance
Checking account debit will be used. (see Sat 01 Feb 2020)

#### Example:
- checking account: 200 EUR
- credit card: -500 EUR
- result: checking account -300 EUR

### Checking acccount debit is not sufficient
I don't know. Likely Fees.

- checking account: 200 EUR
- checking account debit limit: 1000 EUR
- credit card: -1500 EUR
- scenario guessed:
  - checking account: -1000
  - credit card: -300 EUR
  - 7% fees on credit card?
